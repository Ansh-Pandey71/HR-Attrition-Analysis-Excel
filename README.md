📊 HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

🧾 Project Overview
Employee attrition is one of the major challenges organizations face as it directly impacts productivity, workforce stability, and hiring costs. This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns using Microsoft Excel to identify key factors influencing workforce turnover and to support data-driven HR decision-making.

This dashboard provides insights into employee behaviour, attrition drivers, and workforce trends using KPI tracking, pivot analysis, and interactive visualizations.

❗ Problem Statement
